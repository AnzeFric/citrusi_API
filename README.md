# citrusi_API

This is an API for our college project, which acts as a middle point between a mobile app, website, flask server and a database.
It's used to display data on the website, capture and send data from the mobile app to our database and also send images/videos to our flask server for preprocessing and later use in making a model for facial recognition of the specific user.
